Interface: Design based on Material Components and XML.

üíª Tech Stack and Testing - 

Technology -
1. Language - Kotlin
2. UI - XML
3. Architecture - MVVM, Manual DI
4. Unit Testing - JUnit
5. UI Testing -	Espresso
6. Jetpack	ViewModel, LiveData
8. Data Persistence - Room, DataStore
9. Asynchrony	- Coroutines
10. And i used Robolectric only for mock Bundle

‚öôÔ∏è Build and Run Instructions

Clone the repository: 

git clone https://github.com/shiroyoshaa/FinUp.git

Open the project in Android Studio and wait for Gradle to sync.

Click the Run button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) to deploy the app to an emulator or device.

üß™ Running UI Tests (Espresso)
To successfully run UI tests, they must be isolated from external factors like system time, which is critical for month-dependent logic.

Important Step:

You need to open the ProvideViewModel.Base class and manually change the time provider being used: instead of RealProviderBase, you should use mockDateProviderForUiTests to inject static (mocked) time into the components.

Espresso UI Test: navigation to previous month test.
